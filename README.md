#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
- Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles to design, develop, test, and maintain software efficiently and reliably. It ensures software quality, scalability, and security while optimizing development processes. In the tech industry, it enables innovation, supports business operations, and powers critical systems like healthcare, finance, and communication. By following structured methodologies, software engineering reduces errors and enhances user experience. Its importance continues to grow with the increasing reliance on software in everyday life.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. **The Birth of Software Engineering (1968)** – Coined during the NATO Software Engineering Conference, this marked the recognition of software development as an engineering discipline, emphasizing structured methodologies to address the "software crisis."  

2. **The Rise of Object-Oriented Programming (1980s-1990s)** – The adoption of OOP, with languages like C++ and Java, improved code reusability, maintainability, and scalability, revolutionizing software development.  

3. **The Agile Manifesto (2001)** – Introduced Agile methodologies, shifting focus from rigid, document-heavy processes to iterative development, collaboration, and adaptability, shaping modern software engineering practices.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
The **Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)** consists of the following phases:  

1. **Planning** – Defines project goals, scope, resources, and feasibility to ensure successful development.  
2. **Requirement Analysis** – Gathers and documents user needs and system requirements for clarity.  
3. **Design** – Creates system architecture, UI/UX, and database structures based on requirements.  
4. **Implementation (Coding)** – Developers write and integrate code to build the software.  
5. **Testing** – Identifies and fixes bugs through various testing methods to ensure quality.  
6. **Deployment** – Releases the software for users, either as a full launch or in phases.  
7. **Maintenance** – Provides updates, fixes, and enhancements to improve performance and security.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Agile - Focuses on iterative incremental development whereas
Waterfall - Focuses on seeing the final development product and hence imitating a waterfall with showing everything being done and completed.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
- **Software Developer:** Writes, tests, and maintains code to build software solutions.  
- **QA Engineer:** Ensures software quality through testing, bug detection, and compliance checks.  
- **Project Manager:** Oversees planning, execution, and delivery, ensuring deadlines and goals are met.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
**IDEs** streamline development by offering features like code editing, debugging, and compilation in one platform, boosting productivity and error reduction (e.g., **IntelliJ IDEA**, **Visual Studio Code**).  
**Version Control Systems (VCS)** enable collaboration, track changes, and manage code versions, preventing conflicts and ensuring code integrity (e.g., **Git**, **SVN**). Both are essential for efficient, error-free software development.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Software engineers face challenges like managing complex codebases, debugging, time management, staying current with technologies, collaboration issues, and maintaining software quality. Strategies to overcome these include using modular programming, automated testing, Agile methodologies, continuous learning, collaboration tools, and regular code reviews. These approaches help improve productivity, code quality, and team coordination.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

Unit Testing:
Description: Focuses on testing individual components or functions of the code in isolation.
Importance: Ensures that each part of the software works as expected, preventing errors early in development.

Integration Testing:
Description: Tests how different modules or components interact with each other.
Importance: Detects issues related to the integration of different parts of the system, ensuring they work together correctly.

System Testing:
Description: Involves testing the entire system as a whole to verify its functionality and performance against requirements.
Importance: Validates that the complete software system functions properly in a real-world environment.

Acceptance Testing:
Description: Performed to determine whether the software meets user requirements and is ready for deployment.
Importance: Ensures that the software satisfies end-user needs and is ready for release.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
- The art of giving an AI model tasks to do as one gives it detailed sets of tasks. It is important because it helps train models to give us accurate results.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

### **Vague Prompt:**  
*"Create a report on technology."*  

### **Improved Prompt:**  
*"Write a 2-page report on the impact of artificial intelligence in healthcare, focusing on its benefits, challenges, and future trends. Use at least three credible sources and include real-world examples."*  

### **Why the Improved Prompt is More Effective:**  
- **Clarity:** Specifies the topic (AI in healthcare) instead of a broad "technology" focus.  
- **Specificity:** Defines key areas to cover (benefits, challenges, future trends).  
- **Conciseness:** Clearly states expectations (2 pages, 3 sources, real-world examples).  
- **Actionable:** Provides precise instructions, making it easier to complete effectively.
